		<h2>6th Grade Learning</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Microsoft word</li>
			<p> Microsoft word is a basic program that will be very useful in the future for high school and college. The reason being is that I know you will have to write a lot of essays and typing them would make then a whole lot better. This makes a lot of your work professional and will help you look good when making your resume for a job. Although these programs are pretty basic, they will always come in handy in the future and even though you won't think that it is that important, over time you will realize how useful this was for you.</p>
			<li> Microsoft Excel</li>
			<p> Microsoft excel is also a basic program that would be useful for many events. The part that I find the most use for this is recording past test scores and seeing how you have improved or have been failing. This may also come in handy for making a list of people for like a part or something so you know who to invite and their contact information or something like that. Excel is important but that has fewer uses than word but you never know, maybe it might come in handy for you path of career.</p>
			<li> Microsoft Powerpoint</li>
			<p> Microsft powerpoint I think the most signdificant program out of the three. This is the perfect program for creating a presentation for a job or a task. There are so many themes that you can choose from and so many effects you can add when moving from slide to slide. If you were to impress anyone for school, a job, or any kind of presenting, Microsoft powerpoint is the program to use.
		</ol>
		
		<h2> 7th Grade Learning</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Photoshop</li>
			<p>Photoshop isn't really a good program that you would use very often but for some careers like photo editing or something of that sort it would. In photoshop, you can make so many effects on the picture and make it look so much better than before. you can add the smallest detail to make it perfect. The only difficult part is finding the picture and making sure you can use it. If you can't use it, it would be considered breaking the law.
			<li>Illustrator</li>
			<p> Illustraor is more of graphic arts and you have to use the mouse to do the art, rather than in photoshop where the shapes are already made for you. I honestly like phototshop better due to the fact that it is cleaner and that I don't have to have a steady hand to make a straight line.</p>
			<li>Sketchup</li>
			<p> Sketchup is one of my favorite programs because it is the most realistic program that I know. What I mean is that it is 3-D and it gives you a perspective of you being inside the program. Also I like it because you imagination has no limit. You can download different things that would be in a real structure and make you structure look more realisitic. For all of the reasons stated, this is my favorite program.

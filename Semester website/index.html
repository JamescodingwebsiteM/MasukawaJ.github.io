		<h2>Hobbies</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Working on and Using Airsoft Guns</li>
			<p>They are all of my hobbies and I enjoy doing every one of them. Working and using airsoft guns is one of my favorite because it is fun to have competitions with my friends and see who is a better shot but always be sure to always be safe</p>
			<li>Dirt Bike Riding</li>
			<p>Dirt bike riding is really amazing if you know how to ride. Just to be riding is fun and pulling off stunts is cool too. For me, the best part about dirt bike riding is falling and laughing at the past. This really dangerous so practice is always recommended. </p>
			<li>Wakeboarding</li>
			<p> Wakeboarding is always fun during the summer. When it is hot and humid and you just want to cool off, this is the best way and you have fun at the same time. Wakeboarding is fun when you jump over the wake or when you jump over the wave the boat makes. The only difficult part is getting up but it is always fun.</p>
			<li>Painting and Drawing</li>
			<p> Painting and drawing is a good way to calm yourself down. When I create art, I don't get fustrated but stay calm and always think of the possibilities. For instance if you think you made a mistake and you have ruined it, think of what it could be, transform it to something even better. Sometimes I have changed the picture to match the mistake and it always comes out beautiful. </p>
		</ol>

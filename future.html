		<h1> James's Future</h1>
		<h2> Future High School </h2>
		<p> My dream current dream for high school is to be accepted into the California Academy of Math and Science. The reason being is that I want to be an engineer and engineering consists of a great understanding of both math and science. If I get accepted to CAMS, my future will be set and I can pursue my dream of being an aerospace engineer. If I don't get in, I just want to get into an engineering high school.</p>

		<h2> Future College</h2>
		<p> My dream college as of now is MIT. MIT stands for Massachuetts Institue of Tehnology. I want to go to MIT because there, you can learn engineering and create amazing things such as robots and can accomplish missions and do other amazing things. There, you can create your own custom parts and the resources that have there are just a great opportunity. Also, the education you can get there is great and perfect for the engineering field. You would learn about technology, programing, manufacturing and many more great things. </p>
